# üëª Bulgar Development Chop Shop Script

Embark on a risky job as a vehicle thief, where precision, stealth, and strategy are key. Players receive a job and head to a designated zone to find the car's key using a specialized device purchased from an NPC. But be careful‚Äîthere‚Äôs a guard dog on the premises that must be avoided to prevent raising an alarm! Once the car is secured, it's transported to a Chop Shop where the real fun begins‚Äîremoving all doors, the hood, trunk, and tires. But the job isn‚Äôt over yet! Each part must be transported to a different location for sale, maximizing profits for your criminal enterprise.
